# Image Classifier

**It contains two parts:**

-	In this first part of the project, I worked through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with PyTorch
-	I built and trained a deep neural network on the flower data set, by converting my work in Jupyter into an application that others can use. my application is a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line For testing.
